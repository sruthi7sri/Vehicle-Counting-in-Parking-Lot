# Vehicle Counting in Parking Lot

This project implements a real-time vehicle counting system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It automatically identifies vacant and occupied parking slots from video feeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Overview

Urban parking management is challenging due to limited space and high traffic. This system helps monitor parking lot occupancy in real-time, aiding in efficient space utilization and traffic management.

## Approach

- **Data Collection**: Images of parking lots were collected and labeled to indicate occupied and vacant slots.
- **Model Training**: A CNN was trained on the labeled dataset to classify parking slots.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The trained model processes video feeds to detect and count vehicles in each parking slot.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sruthi7sri/Vehicle-Counting-in-Parking-Lot.git
   cd Vehicle-Counting-in-Parking-Lot
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. The system will process the video feed and display the parking lot with occupied and vacant slots marked.
