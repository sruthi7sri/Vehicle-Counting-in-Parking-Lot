# Car Parking System Using Deep Learning

This project implements a real-time car parking space detection system using deep learning and computer vision. It automatically identifies vacant and occupied parking slots from video feeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Overview

Urban parking management is challenging due to limited space and high traffic. This system helps monitor parking spaces using a pre-trained VGG16 model and provides real-time visualization and a web-based API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
